## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned that strikethrough text can be achieved via `text-decoration: line-through`.
I learned how to export an svg from Figma (to replace the shopping cart icon).
And I learned how to use `background-image` in combination with `border-radius`.

### Useful resources
