Pulled specifics from style-guide.md: colors, typography.

Added the colors from style-guide.md to the CSS as variables

Made text-preset classes in CSS, based on typography in figma file's design system
- font weights were listed in the design system as "bold" or "medium" instead of by number as in the font file -> used the weights in the figma file's designs.
- NOPE: style-guide.md specifies weights of 500 & 700

Added the spacings from the design file to CSS as variables

Added HTML: 
- divided into main for product card vs footer for attribution
- main -> article as main container for product card
- within article: two divs, one to contain image, the other for text content, to facilitate changing their flex-direction between column and row for mobile and desktop.

Before creating any more structure: look at design file to see where the spacing is consistent -> what containers should be at same level in hierarchy. Design file showed consistent spacing: between the three text elements, so those go in a container together; between the text, price, and button elements, so those go in a container together.

Nested the product description ("perfume") and the product title, so that I could: put them in reverse order in the HTML, to allow for proper use of h1 tag, for screen readers; then use "flex-direction: column-reverse" to make them appear on the screen in the right order.

Image:
Tried background-image but had problem getting the div to have height. Tried adding an <img> element but would need to use JS to switch out the "src" attribute for desktop/tablet -> Back to background-image, use aspect-ratio to control height. Might be difficult to set desktop sizing this way. Circle back around.

Added padding around the text half of the card
Removed margins from all h1 and p elements
Added display:flex to the container for the text half of the card
Added other flex containers and gaps for spacing as specified

Added font colors
Added strikethrough text (text-decoration: line-through)
Made "perfume" all caps (text-transform: uppercase)
Got the two prices center-aligned vertically (with flexbox)

Added the shopping cart icon. Started with trying to use font-awesome but the icon I needed was behind a paywall -> used the provided icon by embedding svg into html. Removed the "fill" attrubite from the svg element, and instead added its fill property in CSS.

Changed article from display:flex to display: grid so that I can control the width of the two halves on desktop and have them each take up 50% of container width. (Could have also done this with article > div {width: 50%})

Roadblock: border-radius wasn't showing up on outer corners of image. Asked search engine -> got this page which fixed the issue (container {overflow:hidden}).

Moved the card further down the page using transform:translateY. Used a media query to move it down by a smaller amount on phones.

Incorporated media queries for tablets and cleaned up media queries for desktop, with mobile-like rules for narrow desktop windows.

Noticed the cart image I'd used (the one provided) was facing the opposite way from the one in the design file. Tried applying transform:scaleX(-1) to the svg and to its container; didn't work. Then I noticed that the file was different than what's shown in the design file: the handle is on the wrong side. Re-exported the svg from Figma (selected the image -> in the right-side panel, clicked on the plus sign next to "Export" -> saved file). Fixed.
